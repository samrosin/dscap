# Code for "Doubly Standardized Surrogate Endpoints for SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines"

This repository contains files for the simulation study and data application in the manuscript "Doubly Standardized Surrogate Endpoints for SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines" by Rosin, S. P., Stijven, F., Cross., K. A., Shook-Sa, B. E., Hudgens, M. G., \& Gilbert, P. B. (2025). Simulations and analyses were conducted in R on a Slurm-managed High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster.
The \\simulations directory contains all files needed to run the simulations and a README file that explains how the simulation results can be obtained.
The \\data-application directory contains an R-project with all files used in the data application, except the data. The original data cannot be shared, but \\data-application contains README files in which it is explained how the analyses from the data application can be repeated with a simulated data set that is shared as a supplementary file to the manuscript.
