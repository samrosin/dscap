# Simulation code for "Doubly Standardized Surrogate Endpoints for SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines" 

This directory contains the code used for the data application in the manuscript "Doubly Standardized Surrogate Endpoints for SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines" by Rosin, S. P., Stijven, F., Cross., K. A., Shook-Sa, B. E., Hudgens, M. G., & Gilbert, P. B. (2025).

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:
* R/: Contains the R scripts and functions used for the analyses.
* data/: Directory where the data should be stored. This directory also 
  contains an Rscript to process the original data and to generate a synthetic data set from the original data.
  Note that the original data are not included in this repository.
* results/: When running the code, the results (including tables and figures) will be saved here.

Each of thise directories contains its own README file. 
The Makefile allows one to run all Rscripts in the correct order by running `make all` in the console. 

## Reproducibility

The results with the synthetic data can be reproduced by executing the Makefile
(by running `make all` in the command line). This will run all statistical
analyses (which produces results saved to `results/raw-results/`) and will
produce all plots and tables presented in the paper (which are saved to
`results/figures/` and `results/tables/`. Note that this requires the presence
of `data/processed_data_synthetic.csv`. Reproducibility is also facilitated
through the use of the `renv` R package.

Since the analyses are computationally intensive, we ran the analysis on a
Slurm-managed High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster, for which we used the `runanalysis.sh` batch script. If
these analyses are run on a personal computer, there should be enough RAM
available because the sandwich estimator based on the `geex` R package is greedy
in its use of RAM. Running the Makefile is expected to take 10 hours on a recent
personal computer.

## renv

The project uses the `renv` R package for dependency management. This helps to
ensure that the code can be run across devices using similar environments (i.e.,
using the same versions of the required R packages).
